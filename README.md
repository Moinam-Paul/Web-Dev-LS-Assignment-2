# Notes App
This assignment is based on building a Notes App using Bootstrap CSS and React JS alongwith a toggle switch that toggles between Light and Dark Mode.
The following Javascript code contains the following:-
i)Header.js- Contains the heading:-"Notes"
ii)Create.js- To add the title and content which would later appear in the Body section.
iii)Body.js- Contains all the notes I have added thus far.
iv)ToggleDarkorLight.js- Contains the script to toggle between dark and light modes.
P.S.:- I have used some CSS elements like CSS colors (rgb) instead of Bootstrap's predefined colors(warning,danger,etc).
